✨ Starting My Machine Learning Journey! ✨

Hello, everyone! I hope you're all doing great.

Today marks a significant milestone as I dive into my passion: Machine Learning 🧠. On Day 1, I started with the basics, learning:
✅ What Machine Learning is
✅ The differences between Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)
✅ An introduction to Regression

To apply my learning, I completed a mini-project on House Price Prediction 🏠📈. Using Linear Regression from the scikit-learn library, I built a model that predicts house prices based on area.

This is just the beginning, and I'm thrilled about where this journey will take me! 🚀
